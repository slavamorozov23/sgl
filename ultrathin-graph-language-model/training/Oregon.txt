**Oregon**

Oregon is a state on the West Coast of the United States, part of the Pacific States group. The population is 4,241,500 people (2020 data). The capital is Salem, and the largest city is Portland. Other large cities include Eugene, Gresham, Beaverton, Medford, Corvallis, Springfield, and Astoria.

The official motto of the state is "She Flies With Her Own Wings" (Latin: *Alis Volat Propriis*). The official nickname is the "Beaver State". Oregon is the only US state with a two-sided flag. One side displays the state seal, and the reverse side depicts a beaver.

**Geography**
Oregon covers an area of 255,026 km² (ninth place among states). It is bordered by Washington to the north, Idaho to the east, Nevada and California to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Oregon's territory can be divided into six zones. The Oregon Coast Range runs parallel to the Pacific coast in the western part, with the highest point being Marys Peak (1249 m). To the southwest are the Siskiyou Mountains, with Ashland Peak (2296 m) as their highest point. To the east and north of these is the Willamette Valley, with an elevation below 130 m, where about two-thirds of Oregon's population lives. The Cascade Mountains, running north-south across the state, divide it into western and eastern parts. The highest point is the dormant volcano Mount Hood, with a height of 3424-3427 m, which last erupted around 1790. The Cascade Mountains contain numerous geothermal springs. The Deschutes-Umatilla Plateau, in the state's geographical center, is Oregon's "wheat belt". In the northeast are the Blue Mountains (3011 m). In the southeast is the Oregon High Desert, a semi-arid plateau with saline lakes of varying size.

Major rivers include the Columbia (whose basin covers 58% of the state's territory), Willamette, Snake, and Deschutes. Oregon has many lakes, including the country's deepest (589 m) Crater Lake. The climate in the western part of the state is mild and rainy, ranging from 2–10°C (36-50°F) in January to 13–24°C (55-75°F) in July. Precipitation on the western mountain slopes reaches up to 2500 mm (98 inches) per year; in the interior regions, it is no more than 250 mm (10 inches) in the southwest.

**Flora and fauna**
Oregon is home to a unique and diverse array of wildlife. Approximately 60% of the state is covered by forest, while areas west of the Cascade Mountains are even more densely forested, making up about 80% of the landscape. Around 60% of Oregon's forests are on federal land. Oregon is the top lumber producer in the lower 48 states.

**History**
DNA sequencing from coprolites of pre-Clovis people found in Paisley Caves, Oregon, dating back 14,290 - 12,750 years, identified mitochondrial haplogroups A2 and B2. Sagebrush bark sandals found in Fort Rock Cave in 1938 are dated to approximately 7000 or 8000 BC.

In ancient times, indigenous tribes such as the Bannock, Chinook, Klamath, Modoc, and Nez Perce lived in the territory of Oregon. In 1778, James Cook explored the coast of modern Oregon, searching for the Northwest Passage. In 1792, Boston captain Robert Gray navigated the lower Columbia River and named it after his ship. In 1805–1806, the Lewis and Clark Expedition explored the mouth of the Columbia River and established Fort Clatsop.

In 1811, the Pacific Fur Company founded the city of Astoria. Soon, the Hudson's Bay Company also operated in the area. Mass migration of settlers to Oregon began in the 1830s. Early Europeans in the 18th century were initially met friendly by local indigenous people, but later faced active resistance to reservation attempts, leading to conflicts. Russia also claimed territory in Oregon in the 1820s-1830s. In 1846, the Oregon dispute between Great Britain and the United States was resolved. In 1857, the Oregon Constitution was adopted, which, with amendments, remains in effect. On February 14, 1859, Oregon was admitted to the Union as the 33rd state.

In September 1942, the Japanese launched bombing attacks on the state, the only two times the continental U.S. was bombed during World War II.

**Population**
As of July 1, 2013, the population of Oregon was 3,930,065 people, a 2.6% increase since 2010. As of 2004, 309,700 foreign-born individuals resided in Oregon, accounting for 8.7% of the state population, including about 90,000 undocumented immigrants (2.5% of the state population).

Although most people in the state identify as Christian, Oregon has the lowest church attendance rate in the country. For instance, while some states have about 80% church attendance, in Oregon the number is 12%. Nearly one in four residents considers themselves non-religious. The largest community of Russian Old Believers in the U.S., numbering up to 10,000 members, is located in and around Woodburn. Among the Russian community in Portland, as with all residents of the state, the majority belong to Protestant churches, the largest being Baptist and Pentecostal churches.

The state capital is Salem, the largest city is Portland, and Eugene, home to the University of Oregon, is the second-largest city by population, ahead of Salem.

**Economy**
Oregon has minor deposits of metals like gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and chromium (profitable only when prices are high). Oregon is the only significant nickel producer in the U.S. Key industries include logging and wood products, agriculture, and high technology. Oregon has no sales tax.

**Agriculture**
The state is a national leader in the production of hazelnuts (95% of US production), snap beans, broccoli, pears, cherries, strawberries, peppermint, and cranberries (7% of national production). It also has a successful and growing wine industry. Fruit growing is particularly characteristic of the Willamette Valley, while cranberry cultivation is concentrated around Bandon on the Pacific coast.
